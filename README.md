# Anthony Perryman – Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio. I focus on security operations, packet analysis, and incident response, with hands-on experience using Wireshark, Kali Linux, and SOC-style workflows.

This portfolio highlights several home lab projects that demonstrate how I approach security investigations, troubleshooting, and threat analysis.
