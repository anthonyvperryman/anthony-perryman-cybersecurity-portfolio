# PowerShell Log Parsing & Basic Automation

## Goal
Use PowerShell to simplify parts of log review, focusing on filtering and highlighting events of interest.

## Lab Setup
- Windows machine with PowerShell
- Local event logs or exported log files

## What I Did
1. Wrote a basic script to filter logs by event ID, time range, and keyword.
2. Experimented with exporting filtered results for easier review.
3. Focused on events like login failures, account lockouts, and process creation.

## Key Findings
- Even lightweight scripting can significantly reduce manual effort.
- Targeted filtering helps reveal patterns more quickly.
- This approach lays groundwork for more advanced automation and SOAR-style workflows.

## Relevance to a Security Role
Demonstrates initiative in using automation to support investigations and improve efficiency in SOC/ERT environments.

## Tools Used
PowerShell, Windows event logs
