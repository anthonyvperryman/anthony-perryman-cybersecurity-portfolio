# Vulnerability Scan Review & Remediation Planning

## Goal
Practice reading and prioritizing vulnerability scan results, then translating them into a practical remediation plan.

## Lab Setup
- Vulnerability scanner (OpenVAS, Nessus Essentials, or similar)
- One or more Windows/Linux lab systems

## What I Did
1. Ran a full vulnerability scan on a test system.
2. Reviewed findings by CVSS score, exploitability, and exposure.
3. Grouped findings into high, medium, and low priority.
4. Drafted a structured remediation plan with patching, configuration changes, and follow-up scanning.

## Key Findings
- Not all high-severity findings are equally urgent without context.
- Some lower-severity findings combine into larger risk scenarios.
- Clear communication of remediation priorities is critical for effective risk reduction.

## Relevance to a Security Role
Supports vulnerability management, risk assessment, and collaboration with IT teams to reduce attack surface.

## Tools Used
Vulnerability scanner, Windows/Linux
