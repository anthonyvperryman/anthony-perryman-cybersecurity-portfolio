# SOC Alert Triage & Incident Simulation

## Goal
Simulate basic Tier 1/Tier 2 SOC workflows: triage alerts, review logs, determine severity, and document incidents clearly.

## Lab Setup
- Sample system and authentication logs
- Windows Event Viewer or similar tools
- Text editor or spreadsheet for tracking findings

## What I Did
1. Collected logs representing failed logins, unusual sign-ins, and suspicious process launches.
2. Grouped related events into logical incidents instead of treating each entry individually.
3. For higher-risk scenarios, drafted mock incident summaries, including impact, scope, and recommended actions.

## Key Findings
- Gained practice weighing impact and urgency when reviewing multiple events.
- Improved incident documentation and communication skills.
- Reinforced the importance of correlation and context while doing triage.

## Relevance to a Security Role
Directly mirrors the day-to-day responsibilities of SOC and ERT analysts responding to alerts and incidents.

## Tools Used
Log viewers, text editor/spreadsheet
